The [AusNimbus](https://www.ausnimbus.com.au/) builder for Java provides a fast, secure and reliable [Maven hosting](https://www.ausnimbus.com.au/languages/java-hosting/) environment.

It uses Maven to build your application and runs it with OpenJDK. Web processes must bind to port `8080`, and only the HTTP protocol is permitted for incoming connections.
